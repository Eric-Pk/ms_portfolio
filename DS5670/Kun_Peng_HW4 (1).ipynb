A distinction may be made between exclusive monotheism, and both inclusive monotheism and pluriform (panentheistic) monotheism which, while recognising many distinct gods, postulate some underlying unity.\\r\\nMonotheism is distinguished from henotheism, a religious system in which the believer worships one god without denying that others may worship different gods with equal validity, and monolatrism, the recognition of the existence of many gods but with the consistent worship of only one deity.\",\n          \"Historiography is the study of the methodology of historians in developing history as an academic discipline, and by extension is any body of historical work on a particular subject.

Beginning in the nineteenth century, with the ascent of academic history, there developed a body of historiographic literature.

Instead of buying a certain product, they might also buy another, very similar product from a different company.\\r\\nThe word was made during the Irish Land War'. It comes from the name of Captain Charles Boycott. Boycott was in charge of looking after the land of a landlord in County Mayo, Ireland. In 1880, the tenants (those who rented) wanted their rent lowered. Boycott refused, and threw them out of the land they had rented. The Irish Land League then proposed that instead of becoming violent, everyone in the community should stop doing business with Captain Boycott. The captain was soon isolated. No one helped him with the harvest, no one worked in his stables or his house.

A distinction may be made between exclusive monotheism, and both inclusive monotheism and pluriform (panentheistic) monotheism which, while recognising many distinct gods, postulate some underlying unity.\\r\\nMonotheism is distinguished from henotheism, a religious system in which the believer worships one god without denying that others may worship different gods with equal validity, and monolatrism, the recognition of the existence of many gods but with the consistent worship of only one deity.\",\n          \"Historiography is the study of the methodology of historians in developing history as an academic discipline, and by extension is any body of historical work on a particular subject.

Instead of buying a certain product, they might also buy another, very similar product from a different company.\\r\\nThe word was made during the Irish Land War'. It comes from the name of Captain Charles Boycott. Boycott was in charge of looking after the land of a landlord in County Mayo, Ireland. In 1880, the tenants (those who rented) wanted their rent lowered. Boycott refused, and threw them out of the land they had rented. The Irish Land League then proposed that instead of becoming violent, everyone in the community should stop doing business with Captain Boycott. The captain was soon isolated. No one helped him with the harvest, no one worked in his stables or his house.

Blood vessels that take blood away from the heart are arteries. Blood vessels that take blood back to the heart are veins. Capillaries are between veins and arteries and they supply tissue with blood.\\nThe heart plus all of the blood vessels in the body together are called the circulatory system. Blood is moved by the pumping of the heart and carries oxygen to the tissues.\\nThe expansion of blood vessels is called vasodilation, it helps the body to get rid of heat energy (vas- in Latin means \\\"container\\\" or \\\"vessel\\\"). The constriction of blood vessels is called vasoconstriction, it prevents the body from losing warmth.\",\n          \"Many animals develop in separate stages. A larva (plural: larvae) develops from the egg in those animals. It is a separate life stage from the adult reproductive stage. A larva does not look like the adult animal, and changes shape (known as metamorphosis) as it grows up. There may be several larval stages before the adult form. Tadpoles, maggots and caterpillars are larvae.\\nMarine organisms with a larval stage often release large numbers of eggs and sperms into the water column. After fertilisation, the eggs develop into tiny larvae. The larvae develop and grow for some time before metamorphosing into adults. Most marine invertebrates and many fish have a pelagic larval stage or pelagic eggs. These live in the plankton, and may be transported long distances.\",\n          \"The Soviet Union (short for Union of Soviet Socialist Republics or USSR)  was a single-party Marxist-Leninist state. It existed from 1922 until 1991, and was the first country to declare itself socialist and build towards a communist society. It was a union of fourteen Soviet Socialist Republics and one Soviet Federated Socialist Republic (Russia).\\nThe Soviet Union was created after Vladimir Lenin led the overthrow of Alexander Kerensky. The communist government developed industry and over time became a major, powerful union. The largest country in the Union was Russia, and Kazakhstan was the second. The capital city of the Soviet Union was Moscow. Although technically countries could become independent if they wanted, in practice it was a completely centralized government, with no states' rights for the member countries. Many believe that the Soviet Union was the final stage of the Russian Empire; since the USSR covered most of the land of the former Empire.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

Blood vessels that take blood away from the heart are arteries. Blood vessels that take blood back to the heart are veins. Capillaries are between veins and arteries and they supply tissue with blood.\\nThe heart plus all of the blood vessels in the body together are called the circulatory system. Blood is moved by the pumping of the heart and carries oxygen to the tissues.\\nThe expansion of blood vessels is called vasodilation, it helps the body to get rid of heat energy (vas- in Latin means \\\"container\\\" or \\\"vessel\\\"). The constriction of blood vessels is called vasoconstriction, it prevents the body from losing warmth.\",\n          \"Many animals develop in separate stages. A larva (plural: larvae) develops from the egg in those animals. It is a separate life stage from the adult reproductive stage. A larva does not look like the adult animal, and changes shape (known as metamorphosis) as it grows up. There may be several larval stages before the adult form. Tadpoles, maggots and caterpillars are larvae.\\nMarine organisms with a larval stage often release large numbers of eggs and sperms into the water column. After fertilisation, the eggs develop into tiny larvae. The larvae develop and grow for some time before metamorphosing into adults. Most marine invertebrates and many fish have a pelagic larval stage or pelagic eggs. These live in the plankton, and may be transported long distances.\",\n          \"The Soviet Union (short for Union of Soviet Socialist Republics or USSR)  was a single-party Marxist-Leninist state. It existed from 1922 until 1991, and was the first country to declare itself socialist and build towards a communist society. It was a union of fourteen Soviet Socialist Republics and one Soviet Federated Socialist Republic (Russia).\\nThe Soviet Union was created after Vladimir Lenin led the overthrow of Alexander Kerensky. The communist government developed industry and over time became a major, powerful union. The largest country in the Union was Russia, and Kazakhstan was the second. The capital city of the Soviet Union was Moscow. Although technically countries could become independent if they wanted, in practice it was a completely centralized government, with no states' rights for the member countries. Many believe that the Soviet Union was the final stage of the Russian Empire; since the USSR covered most of the land of the former Empire.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

Blood vessels that take blood away from the heart are arteries. Blood vessels that take blood back to the heart are veins. Capillaries are between veins and arteries and they supply tissue with blood.\\nThe heart plus all of the blood vessels in the body together are called the circulatory system. Blood is moved by the pumping of the heart and carries oxygen to the tissues.\\nThe expansion of blood vessels is called vasodilation, it helps the body to get rid of heat energy (vas- in Latin means \\\"container\\\" or \\\"vessel\\\"). The constriction of blood vessels is called vasoconstriction, it prevents the body from losing warmth.\",\n          \"Many animals develop in separate stages. A larva (plural: larvae) develops from the egg in those animals. It is a separate life stage from the adult reproductive stage. A larva does not look like the adult animal, and changes shape (known as metamorphosis) as it grows up. There may be several larval stages before the adult form. Tadpoles, maggots and caterpillars are larvae.\\nMarine organisms with a larval stage often release large numbers of eggs and sperms into the water column. After fertilisation, the eggs develop into tiny larvae. The larvae develop and grow for some time before metamorphosing into adults. Most marine invertebrates and many fish have a pelagic larval stage or pelagic eggs. These live in the plankton, and may be transported long distances.\",\n          \"The Soviet Union (short for Union of Soviet Socialist Republics or USSR)  was a single-party Marxist-Leninist state. It existed from 1922 until 1991, and was the first country to declare itself socialist and build towards a communist society. It was a union of fourteen Soviet Socialist Republics and one Soviet Federated Socialist Republic (Russia).\\nThe Soviet Union was created after Vladimir Lenin led the overthrow of Alexander Kerensky. The communist government developed industry and over time became a major, powerful union. The largest country in the Union was Russia, and Kazakhstan was the second. The capital city of the Soviet Union was Moscow. Although technically countries could become independent if they wanted, in practice it was a completely centralized government, with no states' rights for the member countries. Many believe that the Soviet Union was the final stage of the Russian Empire; since the USSR covered most of the land of the former Empire.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

Blood vessels that take blood away from the heart are arteries. Blood vessels that take blood back to the heart are veins. Capillaries are between veins and arteries and they supply tissue with blood.\\nThe heart plus all of the blood vessels in the body together are called the circulatory system. Blood is moved by the pumping of the heart and carries oxygen to the tissues.\\nThe expansion of blood vessels is called vasodilation, it helps the body to get rid of heat energy (vas- in Latin means \\\"container\\\" or \\\"vessel\\\"). The constriction of blood vessels is called vasoconstriction, it prevents the body from losing warmth.\",\n          \"Many animals develop in separate stages. A larva (plural: larvae) develops from the egg in those animals. It is a separate life stage from the adult reproductive stage. A larva does not look like the adult animal, and changes shape (known as metamorphosis) as it grows up. There may be several larval stages before the adult form. Tadpoles, maggots and caterpillars are larvae.\\nMarine organisms with a larval stage often release large numbers of eggs and sperms into the water column. After fertilisation, the eggs develop into tiny larvae. The larvae develop and grow for some time before metamorphosing into adults. Most marine invertebrates and many fish have a pelagic larval stage or pelagic eggs. These live in the plankton, and may be transported long distances.\",\n          \"The Soviet Union (short for Union of Soviet Socialist Republics or USSR)  was a single-party Marxist-Leninist state. It existed from 1922 until 1991, and was the first country to declare itself socialist and build towards a communist society. It was a union of fourteen Soviet Socialist Republics and one Soviet Federated Socialist Republic (Russia).\\nThe Soviet Union was created after Vladimir Lenin led the overthrow of Alexander Kerensky. The communist government developed industry and over time became a major, powerful union. The largest country in the Union was Russia, and Kazakhstan was the second. The capital city of the Soviet Union was Moscow. Although technically countries could become independent if they wanted, in practice it was a completely centralized government, with no states' rights for the member countries. Many believe that the Soviet Union was the final stage of the Russian Empire; since the USSR covered most of the land of the former Empire.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"bt_readability\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.1540784320921459,\n        \"min\": 0.00500192,\n        \"max\": 0.94795055,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 591,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0.07126335,\n          0.09650815,\n          0.06367458\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Source\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 588,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecology\",\n          \"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precipitation\",\n          \"https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antioxidant\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Topic\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 586,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"diplomacy\",\n          \"mitosis\",\n          \"neuron\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Text type\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Regular\",\n          \"Simple\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Domain\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 3,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Technology\",\n          \"Science\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \" \",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": null,\n        \"min\": null,\n        \"max\": null,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 0,\n        \"samples\": [],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

        "- **Science texts** have the highest mean readability score (**0.186**), followed by **Technology texts** (**0.158**), with **History texts** having the lowest readability score (**0.099**).\n",
        "- A t-test between Science and History reveals a statistically significant difference in readability scores (t-statistic = 6.27, p-value ≈ 0), indicating that Science texts are perceived as more readable than History texts.\n",
        "- These findings suggest that the subject matter and writing style of Science texts might be more accessible compared to History, which might use denser or more complex language.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **2. Weak Correlation Between Lexical Diversity (TTR) and Readability**\n",
        "- There is a weak negative correlation between TTR and readability (correlation coefficient = -0.107, p-value = 0.009).\n",
        "- This implies that texts with higher lexical diversity (more unique words relative to total words) tend to have slightly lower readability scores. However, the effect size is small, indicating other factors likely play a more significant role in determining readability.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **3. Statistical Significance of Findings**\n",
        "- The t-test and correlation results are statistically significant, meaning the observed differences and relationships are unlikely to be due to random chance.\n",
        "- An ANOVA comparing readability scores across all three domains would likely confirm that domain plays a significant role in readability perceptions.\n"
